          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I singned up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, i've successfully swutcged careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup"

          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouranged to enroll by a forner
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. the agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"
